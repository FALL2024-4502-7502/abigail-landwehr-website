      <h1>Where pigs fly: Bear Creek Saloon Pig Races in Montana</h1>
      <p>In Bearcreek, Montana, the Bear Creek Saloon Pig Races are the pride and joy of the town with fewer than a hundred residents. Starting in the summer and continuing through the fall, pig races take place on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays with 12 races on a 15-minute schedule. Each pig is named and sponsored by a local company, and viewers can place their bets on the racers. The winning pig earns half of the $50 race pot, while the other half is allocated to scholarships for high school students in Carbon County.</p>

       The pig wranglers, or "hog reeves," sit off to the side of the track, waiting for the races to begin. They care for the pigs when they aren’t racing and keep them on the course during events.

        Pig races are bet on by buying a square on a board that has 25 squares. Each square costs $2.00. The total prize for the race is $25.00. The other $25.00 goes to a local scholarship fund.
